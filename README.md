### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**TITLE : Recipe Finder Web App**

The Recipe Finder web application is a simple yet effective tool that helps users discover recipes based on available ingredients. By entering a list of ingredients, users can retrieve multiple recipes with images, titles, and direct links to detailed instructions.

**Features :**

✅ User-Friendly Interface – A clean and intuitive design allows users to input ingredients easily.

✅ Dynamic Recipe Fetching – Utilizes the Spoonacular API to fetch real-time recipe suggestions.

✅ Responsive Design – Ensures accessibility across devices.

✅ Background Enhancement – Features a blurred transparent container for a modern look.

**How It Works :**

1. The user enters ingredients in a search box (e.g., "chicken, tomato, garlic").
2. The application sends a request to the Spoonacular API.
3. Matching recipes are displayed dynamically, showing images, names, and clickable links.
4. The user can click on a recipe to view detailed instructions on Spoonacular.

**Technology Stack :**

- **HTML -** Structure of the webpage
- **CSS -** Styling, including a blurred transparent container for a visually appealing design
- **JavaScript (Fetch API) -** Handles API calls and dynamically updates the page
